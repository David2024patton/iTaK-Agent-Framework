## 🧑 You

tell me a funny joke

## 🧙 Wizard

Here's a clean, short, and *actually* funny joke that’s perfect for a quick laugh 😄:

> **Why don’t scientists trust atoms?**  
> *Because they make up everything!*  

*(Punchline twist: It’s a play on the phrase "they make up *for* everything" — but the double meaning lands so weirdly, it’s hilarious!)*

Hope that made you chuckle! 😂 Let me know if you want another — I’ve got a whole vault of puns and punny stories.
